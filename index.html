            <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
              <p> My parents were born in Mexico and came together to the U.S a couple months after they were married. My dad came with his older brothers but then went back for my mom. My mom lived here for a couple years when she was a little girl but she also went back to Mexico. When my parents came I was already on my way so, my mom was pregnant with me when she came. I was born and raised in San Jose, California. I still live here.</p>
            <h2>A Little About Me </h2>
